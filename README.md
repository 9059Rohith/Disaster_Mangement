Sure! Here's a basic `README.md` file for your **AI Disaster Management App (Disaster Guard)** project. It covers setup instructions for both backend and frontend, and can be expanded as needed:

```markdown
# 🌐 Disaster Guard - AI Disaster Management App

An AI-powered platform to report, monitor, and manage disaster-related data in real-time. This application consists of a Node.js + Express backend, a Vite + React frontend, and MongoDB for the database.

## ⚙️ Backend Setup

### 1. Navigate to backend folder

```bash
cd backend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Add `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri-here
```

### 4. Run backend server

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:5000`

## 💻 Frontend Setup

### 1. Navigate to frontend folder

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Add `.env` file (optional for API URL)

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 4. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/` folder, which will be used by the backend to serve the frontend in production.

## 🚀 Deployment (Full Stack)

Ensure your backend is set to serve static files in production:

```javascript
// Inside backend/server.js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/dist')));
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../frontend/dist', 'index.html'));
  });
}
```
